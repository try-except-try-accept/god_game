 Work in progress - a god game / RTS type thing using Pyxel
 
 ## What is it?
 
 My favourite games when I was younger were always RTS e.g. Populous: The Beginning, Age of Empires... so I wanted to have a go at recreating some of the mechanics of a game of this genre. At the moment the game has no real objective, but the following features are in place:
 
 ![Moving followers](images/followers.gif)
 
 1. Select a group of followers to move location
 
 ![Houses](images/houses.gif)
 
 2. Build more houses to spawn more followers
 
 ![Mining some ore](images/mine.gif)
 
 3. Build a mine on top of some ore
 4. Send followers to mine the ore
 
 ![Generating NRG](images/generator.gif)
 
 5. Build a generator to generate energy 
 
 ![Soldiers](images/soldiers.gif)

 6. Build a barracks to train soldiers
 
 ![Tanks](images/tanks.gif)
 
 7. Build a factory to create tanks
 
 ![Scrollin'](images/scrolling.gif)
 
 8. Scroll around the map
 
 9. Listen to the randomly generated chiptune soundtrack
